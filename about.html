  <p>Who is Aaron Reinheimer? I am originally from the Bronx, but am currently living in Highland, New York with my wife and two amazing kids. Having children made me realize I want more out of life, not just for myself, but for my entire family. This inspired me to make a change and that's  when I discovered the career of Software Engineering. This discovery has lead me to a new look on life that I am excited about! </p>
  <p> My entire life I have always been a passionate person, therefore once I'm hooked on something, I'm hooked! Software Engineering falls into that category for me. I have been a huge comic and sports enthustiast for as long as I can remember. That excitement has influenced me to try to incorporate certain aspects of myself into my work. In addition to being passionate, I would describe myself and my personality as animated. I love to integrate that aspect of myself into my work with my favorite css animations. </p>
  <p>I took a huge leap of faith when I jumped into a field I knew nothing about. I was full of uncertainty in the beginning, but once I started I couldn't stop. Its been a long and bumpy road full of trials and tribulations, but a road worth taking. I love what I do and all I have learned along the way. I cannot wait to continue learning and am excited to continue down this path. I always live my life by this quote "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take". This is who Aaron Reinheimer is and I'm the future of web developement!</p>
